Why

- It's ineficient and impracitcal to share all things you're up to with all your colleagues
- Asking questions to everyone in group chats takes lots of time because it consumes the writers time plus the time of every reader
- As a result, people either:
  - end up working with incomplete context because questions are too expensive to ask
  - or end up asking and answering questions to multiple people, inflating meeting and communication time
- We need a way to decrease meeting and communication time, making employees more efficient
